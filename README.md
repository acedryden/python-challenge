# python-challenge
Project consists of two exercises: 
- PyBank runs an analysis on stock value data over the span of several months, returning Total Months, Total Stock Value in $, Average Change, Greatest Increase and Greatest Decrease
- PyPoll runs an analysis on voting information, returning total number of votes, how many votes each candiate recieved, their total share % of votes, and which candiate won the vote.   
The project is useful for showing how simple code with Python can help to quickly analyze large datasets quickly and gain useful and relevant insights. 
Project is solely maintained by Amy Dryden
